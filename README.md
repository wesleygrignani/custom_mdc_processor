# custom_mdc_processor
custom mdc processor for two 8bits input.

The following project was created using the RTL method, first starting by a C-Level code for a mdc function:

The algorithm describes the behavior of the mdc function with control signals and variables to be created. Starting from the C code, we could implement our fist view of a High-Level state machine in order to organize what will happen in each state for the mdc algorithm.
